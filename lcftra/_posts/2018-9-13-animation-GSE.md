This page is under construction.

For testing and calibrating the animation system some Ground Support Equipment (GSE) is required.<!--more-->

This piece of GSE is capable of supplying individual <a href="https://aramder.github.io/animation-bank-module/" target="_blank">valve bank boxes</a> with the control signals needed to either emulate a connection to the<a href="https://aramder.github.io/animation-computer/" target="_blank">main computer</a>, as well as interface a valve bank module with a PC for testing purposes. For more information about how the various pieces of the animation system interface with one another, check out <a href="https://aramder.github.io/animation-summary/" target="_blank">this summary</a> of the new animation system.
