The new La Ca√±ada Flintridge rose parade float's animation system is built in several modular pieces. Four of these units will be responisble for controlling a bank of four hydraulic animation channels.<!--more-->

The new animation system functions in a somewhat similar manner to the old one, though responsibilities are shared slightly differently between the Rexroth and Gilderfluke systems. In this system, closed loop control functions are carried out using a Gilderfluke Br-EFB; the Rexroth valve driver modules only serve to amplify the control signals from the Br-EFB to drive our Rexroth proportional hydraulic valves.
