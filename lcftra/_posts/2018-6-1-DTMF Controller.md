Our float is equiped with a custom built intercom and radio system to allow the float's crew to communicate both within the float, and with external crew. Since the intercom box is mounted remotely, we needed some way to be able to remotely interface with the radio.<!--more--> The solution I came up with was a small perfboard assembly that used a microcontroller to decode DTMF tones received by the float's radio to change the radio's operating channel or toggle a set of relays.
