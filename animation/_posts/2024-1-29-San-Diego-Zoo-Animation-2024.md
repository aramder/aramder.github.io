In late 2023, I was once again contracted by Artistic Entertainment Services (AES) to reconfigure the animatronic control system I designed and built with them for the 2023 parade for reuse on the San Diego Zoo Wild Animal Park's 2024 Tournament of Roses entry. Like last year, this float features a cast of zoo residents animated to interact with riders on the float. I am thrilled that this float won the sweepstakes award for the most beautiful entry!<!--more-->

The main box of the animation computer was relatively unchanged. We only used one of the original four 48V motor drivers, in favor of external 220V VFDs for the remaining three axis of closed loop actuation.

In addition to the addition of three VFSs, we also had to build a DMX relay box for powering motors for the eight flamingos on the float. The flamingo mechanisms were simple 12V brushed motors which drove a cam mechanism to rotate the necks. Rather than running the motors continuously, I pulsed them on and off to achieve the twitching motion displayed by flamingos in packs.

Before installing the various boxes on the float, we set everything up on a bench for a quick test. Here you can see the whole system (from left to right): the VFDs on the far left of the desk before installation in their enclosure, the relay box sitting on the main box, the main controller, the switch box (used to enable axis and provide show control inputs), my <a href="https://aramd.net/G2SE/">custom animation GSE</a>, and laptop.
