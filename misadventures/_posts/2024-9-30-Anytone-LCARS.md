Here's a quick post documenting the LCARS graphics I made for my Anytone AT-D878UVII handheld.<!--more-->

Thanks to this handheld's customizable screens and font colors, it's possible to customize the GUI with some neat graphics. Unfortunately, there are some limitations, such as the all black background that is drawn behind the APRS decode text popups, but it's still fairly neat to play with.

Setting the channel text to orange, and the rest to white, the colors fit the theme reasonably well. I'm not going to go into how to load these images into the radio - there are already plenty of instructions online.
