For TwinleWork's new line of RGBW LED strobes, we needed a new testing assembly. This unit automatically tests each of the LEDs' colors as well as the strobe fixture's temperature sensing circuitry.<!--more-->

The unit is based off of several Meanwell LED drivers, a variety of analog sensing circuitry, a light sensor, and an Arduino Pro Mini.

The pogo sticks stick out of a 3D printed assembly for lining up the strobe PCBAs, which also protects the user from 1000s of lumens of light output.

The fixture can test PCBs in a matter of seconds. Terminal blocks (which will be connected to test clips) will also allow for completed strobes to be connected to the tester and tested once assembled.

A work in progress datasheet for the RGBW strobe can be found <a href="https://aramder.github.io/images/TwinkleWorks/RGBW Strobe Spec Sheet [NOT FINAL].pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, *for reference only*.
