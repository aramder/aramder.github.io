For TwinleWork's new line of RGBW LED strobes, we needed a new testing assembly. This unit automatically tests each of the LEDs' colors as well as the strobe fixture's temperature sensing circuitry.<!--more-->

The unit is based off of several Meanwell LED drivers, a variety of analog sensing circuitry, a light sensor, and an Arduino Pro Mini.

**This is a work in progress**

The pogo stick PCB testing portion of this testing jig still needs to be made. The rendering below shows approximately how the jig is going to be assembled.
