### Hello! I'm Aram Dergevorkian

I'm an undergraduate electrical engineering student at Cal Poly Pomona.

For the last 3 summers I've been an intern at the <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a>, working in the Microwave Remote Sensing Instruments group. For the last two summers I've been working on low power instrument controllers for CubeSats/SmallSats using FPGAs, softcore processors, and radhard ARMs.

Though not a UCLA student, I spent a summer, in addition to time part time during the schoolyear, working on UCLA’s <a href="https://elfin.igpp.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">Electron Loses and Fields Investigation</a> (ELFIN) CubeSat. As part of the communications subsystem team, I tested the spacecraft’s prototype and flight radios, performed antenna testing in the field, and aided in tests between spacecraft models and UCLA’s ground station.

For about two years, I worked part time at <a href="http://www.aescreative.com/" target="_blank">Artistic Entertainment Services</a> developing <a href="http://aramd.net/TwinkleWorks/" target="_blank">TwinkleWorks</a> LED lighting products.

I also volunteer with the <a href="https://lcftra.org/home.php" target="_blank">La Cañada Flintridge Tournament of Roses Association</a> where I'm responsible for electronics and the development of our <a href="https://aramder.github.io/animation-2019" target="_blank">new animation system</a>.

A current resume can be found <a href="https://aramd.net/no robots/Aram Dergevorkian Resume Dec 2018.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
