### Hello! I'm Aram Dergevorkian

I'm an Electrical Engineer at the Amazon Web Service Center for Quantum Computing in Pasadena California. I've been working there as a mixed signal designer December 2024.

Previously, I had worked at the <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a>, starting in 2016 as an intern and transitioning to full time in 2021. My most recent project before my departure in 2024 was designing the instrument Command and Data Handling system for the <a href="https://sbg.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">Surface Biology and Geology</a> mission's TIR (Thermal InfraRed) satellite's OTTER (Orbiting Terrestrial Thermal Emission Radiometer) instrument. From approximately 2021 through 2024, I worked on the MEM (Microwave Electrojet Magnetogram) instrument for the EZIE (<a href="https://ezie.jhuapl.edu/" target="_blank">The Electrojet Zeeman Imaging Explorer</a>) mission as the Digital Backend Electronics Cognizant Engineer. From 2016 to 2021, I worked on low power instrument control applications - culmniating in the delivery of the Command and Data Handling, and Motor Electronics assemblies for the PREFIRE (<a href="https://prefire.ssec.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">Polar Radiant Energy in the Far-InfraRed Experiment</a>) CubeSat as Motor Electronics Cognizant Engineer.

Since 2022, I've also been working as an independent contractor designing and implementing custom electronics. In parallel with developing commercial electronics for sale, I have delivered animatronic control systems for <a href="http://www.aescreative.com/" target="_blank">Artistic Entertainment Services</a> for a number of their Rose Parade float entries. I also continue to consult with self-built (volunteer operated) entrants in the Rose Parade such as the <a href="https://lcftra.org/" target="_blank">La Cañada Flintridge Tournament of Roses Association</a> where I volunteered from 2011 to 2019 and was responsible for the development of their <a href="https://aramder.github.io/animation-2019">new animation system</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.rosefloat.org/" target="_blank">Cal Poly Rose Float</a> which I worked on very briefly during my time at Cal Poly Pomona.

In late 2023, I joined the <a href="https://lalsrm.org/" target="_blank">Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum</a>. The railroad is unique in that it's the only fully signal controlled scale railroad in the United States - as we like to point out: *we're a real railroad, just a small one*. I enjoy repairing and upgrading signal infrastructure with friends, and, of course, operating scale trains! In addition to a few contributions to *Signals 2.0*, as we're calling the new fully networked digital control system. I'm also working on a train defect detector, which I hope to make a post about once it's developed a bit further.

From 2017 to 2018 I worked part time at <a href="http://www.aescreative.com/" target="_blank">Artistic Entertainment Services</a> developing <a href="http://aramd.net/TwinkleWorks/">TwinkleWorks</a> LED lighting products. The scope of my work also involved UL 508A industrial control panel work for various entertainment industry applications.

Though not a UCLA student at the time, I spent a summer, in addition to time part time during the schoolyear, working on UCLA’s ELFIN (<a href="https://elfin.igpp.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">Electron Loses and Fields Investigation</a>) CubeSat from 2015 to 2016. As part of the communications subsystem team, I tested the spacecraft’s prototype and flight radios, performed antenna testing in the field, and aided in tests between spacecraft models and UCLA’s ground station.
