### Hello! I'm Aram Dergevorkian

I'm an Electronics Engineer at the <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a>. Since August of 2021, I have been working on the Digital Backend Electronics for the MEM (Microwave Electrojet Magnetogram) instrument for the EZIE (The Electrojet Zeeman Imaging Explorer) mission.

From 2016 to 2021, I had been an intern and contractor at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, first working in the Microwave Remote Sensing Instruments group, and the PREFIRE (<a href="https://prefire.ssec.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">Polar Radiant Energy in the Far-InfraRed Experiment</a>) CubeSat instrument electronics team. I've mainly worked on low power instrument controllers for CubeSats/SmallSats utilizing FPGAs, softcore processors, and radhard ARMs. 

Though not a UCLA student at the time, I spent a summer, in addition to time part time during the schoolyear, working on UCLA’s ELFIN (<a href="https://elfin.igpp.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">Electron Loses and Fields Investigation</a>) CubeSat from 2015 to 2016. As part of the communications subsystem team, I tested the spacecraft’s prototype and flight radios, performed antenna testing in the field, and aided in tests between spacecraft models and UCLA’s ground station.

From 2017 to 2018 I worked part time at <a href="http://www.aescreative.com/" target="_blank">Artistic Entertainment Services</a> developing <a href="http://aramd.net/TwinkleWorks/">TwinkleWorks</a> LED lighting products. The scope of my work also involved UL 508A industrial control panel design and assembly for various entertainment industry applications.

From 2011 to 2019 I volunteered with the <a href="https://lcftra.org/home.php" target="_blank">La Cañada Flintridge Tournament of Roses Association</a> where I was responsible for electronics and the development of their <a href="https://aramder.github.io/animation-2019">new animation system</a>.
