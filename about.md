### Hello! I'm Aram Dergevorkian

I'm a 5th year undergraduate electrical engineering student at Cal Poly Pomona.

For the last 5 years I've been an intern at the <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a>, first working in the Microwave Remote Sensing Instruments group, and now with the PREFIRE (<a href="https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/projects/PREFIRE/" target="_blank">Polar Radiant Energy in the Far-InfraRed Experiment</a>) CubeSat electronics team. I've mainly worked on low power instrument controllers for CubeSats/SmallSats utilizing FPGAs, softcore processors, and radhard ARMs. 

Though not a UCLA student, I spent a summer, in addition to time part time during the schoolyear, working on UCLA’s ELFIN (<a href="https://elfin.igpp.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">Electron Loses and Fields Investigation</a>) CubeSat. As part of the communications subsystem team, I tested the spacecraft’s prototype and flight radios, performed antenna testing in the field, and aided in tests between spacecraft models and UCLA’s ground station.

For about two years, I worked part time at <a href="http://www.aescreative.com/" target="_blank">Artistic Entertainment Services</a> developing <a href="http://aramd.net/TwinkleWorks/">TwinkleWorks</a> LED lighting products.

For nearly 9 years, I volunteered with the <a href="https://lcftra.org/home.php" target="_blank">La Cañada Flintridge Tournament of Roses Association</a> where I was responsible for electronics and the development of their <a href="https://aramder.github.io/animation-2019">new animation system</a>.
